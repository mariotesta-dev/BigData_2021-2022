# BigData_2021-2022
This repository contains my personal solutions for exam-like exercises of the course "Big Data Architectures" held on Polytechnic University of Turin in academic year 2021/2022.

### Disclaimer:
The solutions proposed are just for demonstration purpose, they haven't been tested. <br/>They don't replace teaching material, but can be used to understand the thinking behind the exercises and how to approach them.
